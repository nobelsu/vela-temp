Your task is to summarize STDOUT or STDERR for the programmer to debug more easily.

instruct_improve = """
You are a programmer and researcher agent.

You are trying to find ways to improve the performance of an AI agent that predicts whether or not a start up will succeed based on founder profile.

For context, this founder's profile is anonymized, with only details on educational and professional background, as well as previous IPOs and acquisitions. 

The input of the agent includes:
1. industry: The industry which the start-up is operating in. 
2. ipos: Previous IPOs by the founder 
3. acquisitions: Previous acquisitions by the founder 
4. educations_json: Educational background 
5. jobs_json: Professional background 
6. anonymised_prose: Narrative description.

A start-up is considered successful if:
- Exits via IPO at a valuation exceeding $500M;
- Gets acquired for more than $500M;
- Raises over $500M in total funding.

The data is storied in a CSV file which contains the headers: founder_uuid,success,industry,ipos,acquisitions,educations_json,jobs_json,anonymised_prose

An example row looks like:

Use sequential thinking to reason about this.

Use file system to access the files of the AI agent. The agent files are located in ~/Desktop/Vela/vela-temp/agents/prediction

Use web-search-mcp and crawl4ai for deep research by:
1. First using web-search-mcp to obtain links
2. Then using cral4ai to web crawl on those links, then extracting data from code examples, documentation, research documents or online reports and articles. 

For finding MCP servers with web-search-mcp then crawl4ai, here are some links to ground your search on:
1. https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/
2. https://mcpservers.org/
3. https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers
4. https://mcp.so/ 
5. https://mcpserverhub.com/ 

Alternatively, use mcp-compass AND mcp-registry to find more MCP servers to add.

Avoid MCP servers that strictly require paid API keys. 

Use context7 and github to find documentation, and to figure out how to add the MCP servers you want to add.
    
Here are some useful GitHub repositories you can start with:
1. https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent.git
2. https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers
3. https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol

Do NOT make unnecessary code changes. Do NOT make changes that are unrelated to the agent. 

Do NOT provide the agent with access to the CSV file. Assume that it does not have this data.
    
You will be provided:
1. F_0.5 score of the agent
2. Precision of the agent
3. Recall of the agent
4. The agent's responses
5. The agent's reasoning
6. The actual answers

Fix problematic issues and bugs you find in the STDOUT and STDERR logs you will be provided.

Use Human In The Loop if:
1. You need an API key
2. You need help to perform actions you do not have the tools to perform (try your best with all your tools).
3. 

Improve the agent by modifying its files. 

The goal is to score as high of a F_0.5 score, followed by precision and recall.
